    <h2>Q1. Create 2 objects - parent and child. Attach methods to parent and use those methods in child object using parents prototype</h2>
    <h3><pre>        
        const parent = {
            surname : 'Mishra',
            display : function()
            {
                console.log("Hello .. Aniket.....")
            }
        }

        const child1 = Object.create(parent)
        child1.name = "Aniket";
        console.log(`${child1.name} ${child1.surname}`)
    </pre></h3>
    <h2>Q2. Write code to explain prototype chaining</h2>
    <h3><pre>let arr = [a,b,c]

        The prototype chain is a mechanism that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects.
         Every object can have exactly one prototype object. 
        That prototype object can also have a prototype object, and so on, creating a chain of inheritied properties and methods.

        In the above code the prototype of that is initially is array and after that in proto it will shows object and after that once
         again it will show object and at the end the proto shows the null. It means the chain is reached at its maximum.
    </pre></h3>
    <h2>Q3.Add a method to calculate sum of all elements in Array in array's protype, use that method to calculate sum for multiple arrays</h2>
    <h3><pre>
        var arr = [1,2,3,4,5,2]

        function sum(arr)
        {

        let ans  = arr.reduce((acc,curr)=>acc+curr);
        console.log(ans)
        }sum(arr)
    </pre></h3>
    <h2>Q4.Write a JavaScript function to retrieve all the names of object's own and inherited properties.</h2>
    <h3><pre>
        class Animal
        {     
            constructor(name,age)
            {      
           this.name = name;        
            this.age = age;     
            }     
        
            demo(){         
            console.log(this.name,this.age);     
            } 
        }
        //inherit class class Dog extends Animal{

              } 
        let value = new Dog('tommy',11); value.demo();
    </pre></h3>
